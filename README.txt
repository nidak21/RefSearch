RefSearch is about:  	May 2016
    1) trying to use Elsevier's SciDirect API for full text searches of
	their articles, playing with different queries and comparing those
	results to MGI's "gold standard" curator selected papers.

	Also playing with the SciDirect API, building wrapper to talk to
	that API.

	This work is in the SciDirectComp directory, and is old (2014).

    2) building a web app to a) learn Flask, and b) to provide an interface
    	for playing with this full text search.

	As part of this, I evolved the SciDirect.py wrapper significantly.
